function [agt,inf]=infected(agt,cn)

%infected function for class HEALTHY_HUMAN
%agt=healthy_human object
%cn - current agent number

global PARAM IT_STATS N_IT MESSAGES
%N_IT is current iteration number
%IT_STATS is data structure containing statistics on model at each
%iteration (no. agents etc)
%PARAM is data structure containing migration speed and spawning
%frequency parameters for both infected humans and healthy humans
%MESSAGES is a data structure containing information that agents need to
%broadcast to each other
